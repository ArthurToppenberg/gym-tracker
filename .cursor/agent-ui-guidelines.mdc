# UI Guidelines for Cursor Agent

- All UI should be built using the `@gym/ui` package.
- The `@gym/ui` package is a wrapper around [shadcn/ui](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) components.
- When building UI, leverage knowledge of shadcn components, props, and patterns.
- Do not use raw shadcn components directlyâ€”always use the exported components from `@gym/ui`.
- Follow best practices for composability and accessibility as established by shadcn.
- If a component or pattern exists in shadcn, assume a similar API is available in `@gym/ui` unless otherwise specified.
